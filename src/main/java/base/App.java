Example Output

What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

Constraints

Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.

Challenge

Modify this program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create a structure that holds quotes and
their associated attributions and then display all of the quotes using the format in the example. An array of maps would be a good choice.
